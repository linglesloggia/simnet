# PyWiSim laboratory

A discrete-event, system level wireless communications simulator and framework.

This project focuses on adapting PyWiSim to be utilized as a laboratory environment for the IMT Summer School 2024. The original simulator, which is still under development, provides a foundational framework that this project builds upon. Both this adaptation and the original project are licensed for use.

PyWiSim is an event-driven, system level wireless communications simulator. Its main purpose is to model a wireless network with the minimum entities required to estimate performance in large systems (systems with many nodes). It is also expected PyWiSim to be flexible enough to allow its seamless extension towards 5G, LTE, IEEE 802,11, and other types of network. To achieve these goals, PyWiSim intends to provide a straightforward architectural design with high modularization and low coupling, able to act as a framework where new algorithms and procedures of different standards, protocols and telecommunications technologies can be naturally integrated.
